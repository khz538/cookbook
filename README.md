## Bienvenue et Bon Appetit!

CookBook takes heavy inspiration from the [New York Times Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/). With a similar goal of providing a platform to share good food from anywhere the internet can reach, users can upload their own recipes for others to try, or try recipes others have uploaded.

### Wiki
Take a gander at the [Wiki](https://github.com/khz538/nyt-cooking-clone/wiki) for information about the app.
There, you can find the Feature List, User Stories, the backend Database Schema, and a wireframe that inspired the look and feel of the app!
